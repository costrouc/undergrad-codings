Scratch
==============

A personal collection of some of the files that I have written as a
programmer. Most of them that I find interesting use a special kind of
data structure or find interesting results. I slowly merge projects
that I have completed into this folder. Most of the files are written
in C, C++, Matlab and a few (2) are written in java. Some the bigger libraries
used include OpenGL, OpenCL, LA-PACK, SCALAPACK, MPI. While I
occasionally use smaller libraries that are included in the
folder. Typically I inlclude a nice makefile in each directory to
demonstrate the features that the program did. Because as we all know
we tend to forget how to run our own programs. I have tried to include
dates in the files when they were written so it may be possible to
watch how my coding skills have improved!

Anyways if you do look into this repository enjoy!
